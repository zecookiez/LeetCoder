# LeetCode Problems and Solutions
_Last Updated Problem Set: **December 31, 2018**_

#### Repo format made by [MrMiaoMiao](https://github.com/MrMiaoMiao)

## Note:
This repo is made so that I can track my progress starting January 2019 with the goal being at least 1 question per day. Most problems will be solved using C++ with the exception of Shell and Database questions. I will also try to comment my code as much as possible to make it more readable for future reference.
